This document notes how to use RDFPath precompiled binary (Jar) to evaluate RDFPath queries.


1. Settings
Query engine settings are defined in a file named RDFPATH.conf placed in the same folder with the jar.
The syntax is simple everything is defined as key,value. and comments are rows that start with #. 
One example of this configuration file is the file named RDFPATH.conf placed in the same folder with this file.
Settings can also be defined inline, and override the settings from the file they are explained down at query
evaluation section


2. Query Evaluation

Here is explained the syntax how to make use of RDFPath engine:

java -jar RDFPathEngine.jar [CLASS] [-f|-q] [path|Query] [Settings]

To switch between Spark and Impala one has to call different classes of Jar. (Executor.AppSpark for Spark, and Executor.AppImpala for Impala)

The first parameter notes whether the query is given from a file (-f) or as inline string (-q). Based on this the second 
parameter can be path to file or actual query.

Inline settings are declared as last parameter with the order: Graph ShuffleParttionsNR ExtVP ExecStrategy.

3. Examples

Spark, query given from file /home/file.txt

java -jar RDFPathEngine.jar Executor.AppSpark -f /home/file.txt  

Impala, query given inline: Bob./knows/age

java -jar RDFPathEngine.jar Executor.AppImpala -q Bob./knows/age


***NOTE: In order to run the code one should also include atlr4-runtime binary version 4.5
